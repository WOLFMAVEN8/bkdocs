{{<hint danger>}}### Breaking Changes{{</hint>}}

A breaking change is a change that would require you to go back to your integration with Alpaca and make some changes to ensure the continuity of service to your users.

We will all do all that is possible to make sure that we do not push any breaking changes. In all cases, we will communicate those changes before they take effect.

Example of breaking changes can be, but not limited to:

- Changes to required parameters
- New ENUM values

{{<hint warning>}}### Non-Breaking Changes{{</hint>}}

Non breaking changes are soft changes to existing functionality. Those changes have been tested against the current version of Broker API and has been cleared for release.

We will likely communicate those changes after they're made.

Some examples to those can be:

- New optional parameters to API endpoints
- Removal of optional parameters to API endpoints
- Addition of new fields to existing endpoints

{{<hint info>}}### New Features {{</hint>}}

Those are considered to be completely new functionality enabled by Broker API.
